	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The effect of exposure to allergens not causing sensitisation in atopic asthmatic subjects has not previously been studied. A study was undertaken to assess the degree of asthma severity (measured by spirometry, airway reactivity and exhaled nitric oxide) in atopic asthmatic patients not sensitised to the domestic allergen to which they were exposed.
METHODS: Dust samples were collected from the living room carpet and mattress in the homes of 248 subjects and dust mite, cat and dog allergen concentrations were measured. Spirometry, non-specific bronchial reactivity (BR), and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) were ascertained. Patients' sensitisation status was assessed by skin prick testing.
RESULTS: Adult atopic asthmatics not sensitised to mite but exposed to high levels of mite allergen had significantly more severe BR than subjects not exposed to high levels of mite (PD(20), geometric mean (GM) 0.21 mg (95% CI 0.09 to 0.47) v 0.86 mg (95% CI 0.44 to 1.67), mean ratio difference 4.1 (95% CI 1.5 to 11.4), p=0.008). Subjects not sensitised but exposed to high levels of dog allergen also had significantly more severe BR than subjects not exposed (PD20 GM 0.16 v 0.52 mg, mean ratio difference 3.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 9.2), p=0.01). The differences in BR between these groups were still significant after adjusting for confounding factors. This effect of greater airway reactivity was not seen in subjects exposed but not sensitised to cat allergens.
CONCLUSION: Atopic asthmatic subjects who are exposed to high levels of dust mite or dog allergens but not sensitised to these allergens have evidence of increased airway reactivity.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Exposure to air pollution during infancy has been related to lung function decrements in 8-year-old children, but whether the negative effects remain into adolescence is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relationship between long-term air pollution exposure and lung function up to age 16 years.
METHODS: A total of 2,278 children from the Swedish birth cohort BAMSE (Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiological Survey) performed spirometry at age 16 years. Levels of outdoor air pollution from local road traffic were estimated (nitrogen oxides [NOx] and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <10 μm [PM10]) for residential, daycare, and school addresses during the lifetime using dispersion modeling. Associations between exposure in different time windows and spirometry indexes were analyzed by linear regression and mixed effect models.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution during the first year of life was associated with FEV1 at age 16 years of -15.8 ml (95% confidence interval [CI], -33.6 to 2.0 for a 10 μg/m(3) difference in NOx), predominately in males (-30.4 ml; 95% CI, -59.1 to -1.7), and in subjects not exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy or infancy. Later exposures appeared to have had an additional negative effect. High exposure during the first year of life was also associated with odds ratios for FEV1 and FVC less than the lower limit of normal (LLN) (defined as a z-score < -1.64 SD) of 3.8 (95% CI, 1.3-10.9) and of 4.3 (95% CI, 1.2-15.0), respectively. The results for PM10 were similar to those for NOx.
CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to traffic-related air pollution in infancy is negatively associated with FEV1 at age 16 years, leading to increased risk of clinically important deficits.},

	Abstract = {One of the major drawbacks of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been the lack of a standard and quantifiable interpretation of image intensities. Unlike in other modalities, such as X-ray computerized tomography, MR images taken for the same patient on the same scanner at different times may appear different from each other due to a variety of scanner-dependent variations and, therefore, the absolute intensity values do not have a fixed meaning. We have devised a two-step method wherein all images (independent of patients and the specific brand of the MR scanner used) can be transformed in such a way that for the same protocol and body region, in the transformed images similar intensities will have similar tissue meaning. Standardized images can be displayed with fixed windows without the need of per-case adjustment. More importantly, extraction of quantitative information about healthy organs or about abnormalities can be considerably simplified. This paper introduces and compares new variants of this standardizing method that can help to overcome some of the problems with the original method.},

@article{Tustison:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Segmenting and quantifying gliomas from MRI is an important task for diagnosis, planning intervention, and for tracking tumor changes over time. However, this task is complicated by the lack of prior knowledge concerning tumor location, spatial extent, shape, possible displacement of normal tissue, and intensity signature. To accommodate such complications, we introduce a framework for supervised segmentation based on multiple modality intensity, geometry, and asymmetry feature sets. These features drive a supervised whole-brain and tumor segmentation approach based on random forest-derived probabilities. The asymmetry-related features (based on optimal symmetric multimodal templates) demonstrate excellent discriminative properties within this framework. We also gain performance by generating probability maps from random forest models and using these maps for a refining Markov random field regularized probabilistic segmentation. This strategy allows us to interface the supervised learning capabilities of the random forest model with regularized probabilistic segmentation using the recently developed ANTsR package--a comprehensive statistical and visualization interface between the popular Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) and the R statistical project. The reported algorithmic framework was the top-performing entry in the MICCAI 2013 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation challenge. The challenge data were widely varying consisting of both high-grade and low-grade glioma tumor four-modality MRI from five different institutions. Average Dice overlap measures for the final algorithmic assessment were 0.87, 0.78, and 0.74 for "complete", "core", and "enhanced" tumor components, respectively.},

	Abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},

	Abstract = {A variant of the popular nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3) algorithm is proposed for bias field correction. Given the superb performance of N3 and its public availability, it has been the subject of several evaluation studies. These studies have demonstrated the importance of certain parameters associated with the B-spline least-squares fitting. We propose the substitution of a recently developed fast and robust B-spline approximation routine and a modified hierarchical optimization scheme for improved bias field correction over the original N3 algorithm. Similar to the N3 algorithm, we also make the source code, testing, and technical documentation of our contribution, which we denote as "N4ITK," available to the public through the Insight Toolkit of the National Institutes of Health. Performance assessment is demonstrated using simulated data from the publicly available Brainweb database, hyperpolarized (3)He lung image data, and 9.4T postmortem hippocampus data.},

@article{Collins:1994aa,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In both diagnostic and research applications, the interpretation of MR images of the human brain is facilitated when different data sets can be compared by visual inspection of equivalent anatomical planes. Quantitative analysis with predefined atlas templates often requires the initial alignment of atlas and image planes. Unfortunately, the axial planes acquired during separate scanning sessions are often different in their relative position and orientation, and these slices are not coplanar with those in the atlas. We have developed a completely automatic method to register a given volumetric data set with Talairach stereotaxic coordinate system.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The registration method is based on multi-scale, three-dimensional (3D) cross-correlation with an average (n > 300) MR brain image volume aligned with the Talariach stereotaxic space. Once the data set is re-sampled by the transformation recovered by the algorithm, atlas slices can be directly superimposed on the corresponding slices of the re-sampled volume. the use of such a standardized space also allows the direct comparison, voxel to voxel, of two or more data sets brought into stereotaxic space.
RESULTS: With use of a two-tailed Student t test for paired samples, there was no significant difference in the transformation parameters recovered by the automatic algorithm when compared with two manual landmark-based methods (p > 0.1 for all parameters except y-scale, where p > 0.05). Using root-mean-square difference between normalized voxel intensities as an unbiased measure of registration, we show that when estimated and averaged over 60 volumetric MR images in standard space, this measure was 30% lower for the automatic technique than the manual method, indicating better registrations. Likewise, the automatic method showed a 57% reduction in standard deviation, implying a more stable technique. The algorithm is able to recover the transformation even when data are missing from the top or bottom of the volume.
CONCLUSION: We present a fully automatic registration method to map volumetric data into stereotaxic space that yields results comparable with those of manually based techniques. The method requires no manual identification of points or contours and therefore does not suffer the drawbacks involved in user intervention such as reproducibility and interobserver variability.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate a small pilot group of ex-smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and healthy volunteers during approximately 2 years by using hyperpolarized helium 3 ((3)He) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All subjects provided written informed consent to the study protocol, which was approved by the local research ethics board and Health Canada and was compliant with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and HIPAA. Hyperpolarized (3)He MR imaging, hydrogen 1 MR imaging, spirometry, and plethysmography were performed in 15 ex-smokers with COPD and five healthy volunteers (with the same mean age and age range) at baseline and 26 months +/- 2 (standard deviation) later. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) derived from (3)He MR imaging were calculated from diffusion-weighted (3)He MR images, and (3)He ventilation defect volume (VDV) and ventilation defect percentage (VDP) were generated after manual segmentation of (3)He MR spin-density images.
RESULTS: For subjects with COPD, significant increases in (3)He MR imaging-derived VDV (P = .03), VDP (P = .006), and ADC (P = .02) were detected, whereas there was no significant change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) (P = .97). For healthy never-smokers, there was no significant change in imaging or pulmonary function measurements at follow-up. There was a significant correlation between changes in FEV(1) and changes in VDV (r = -0.70, P = .02) and VDP (r = -0.70, P = .03).
CONCLUSION: For this small pilot group of ex-smokers with COPD, (3)He MR imaging-derived VDV, VDP, and ADC measurements worsened significantly, but there was no significant change in FEV(1), suggesting increased sensitivity of hyperpolarized (3)He MR imaging for depicting COPD changes during short time periods.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the emphysematous enlargement of distal airspaces and concomitant large and small airway disease using diffusion-weighted Helium-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and lung function tests (LFT).
METHODS: Seven patients were examined after single lung transplantation (LTx) and 1 before double LTx for various forms of emphysema. Five patients after double LTx served as controls. Patients were assessed by Helium-MRI (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]), HRCT (mean lung density [MLD], emphysema index [EI]), and LFT.
RESULTS: Transplanted lungs: mean ADC = 0.17 cm/s, MLD = -848 H, EI = 22%. Emphysematous lungs: mean ADC = 0.33 cm/s, MLD = -922 H; EI = 54%. Good correlations were found between ADC and MLD (r = 0.6), EI (r = 0.8), intrathoracic gas volume (r = 0.7), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (r = 0.7), and forced expiratory flows (r = 0.7). In contrast, HRCT only provided moderate correlations with LFT (EI: r = 0.5; MLD: r [le] 0.4).
CONCLUSION: In this initial study, He-MRI yield good correlations with HRCT and agrees better than HRCT with the functional characterization of emphysema regarding hyperinflation, large and small airway disease as provided by LFT.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To improve intra- and interobserver variability and enable the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for multicenter, multiobserver studies, we generated a semiautomated segmentation method for hyperpolarized helium-3 ((3)He) MRI. Therefore the objective of this study was to compare the reproducibility and spatial agreement of manual and semiautomated segmentation of (3)He MRI ventilation defect volume (VDV) and ventilation volume (VV) in subjects with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis (CF).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The multistep semiautomated segmentation method we developed employed hierarchical K-means clustering to classify (3)He MRI pixel intensity values into five user-determined clusters ranging from signal void to hyperintense. A seeded region-growing algorithm was also used to segment the (1)H MRI thoracic cavity for coregistration to the (3)He cluster-map, generating VDV and VV.
RESULTS: We compared manual segmentation performed by an expert observer and semiautomated measurements of (3)He MRI VDV and observed strong significant correlations between the volumes generated using each method (asthma, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001; COPD, n = 5, r = 0.84, P < .0001; CF, n = 5, r = 0.89, P < .0001). Semiautomated VDV had high interobserver reproducibility (coefficient of variation [CV] = 7%, intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.96); intraobserver reproducibility was significantly higher for semiautomated (CV = 5%, ICC = 1.00) compared to manual VDV (CV = 12%, ICC = 0.98). Spatial agreement for VV determined using the Dice coefficient (D) was also high for all disease states (asthma, D = 0.95; COPD, D = 0.88; CF, D = 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: Semiautomated segmentation (3)He MRI provides excellent inter- and intraobserver precision with high spatial and quantitative agreement with manual measurements enabling its use in longitudinal studies.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

	Abstract = {A computational framework is described that was developed for quantitative analysis of hyperpolarized helium-3 MR lung ventilation image data. This computational framework was applied to a study consisting of 55 subjects (47 asthmatic and eight normal). Each subject was imaged before and after respiratory challenge and also underwent spirometry. Approximately 1600 image features were calculated from the lungs in each image. Both the image and 27 spirometric features were ranked based on their ability to characterize clinical diagnosis using a mutual information-based feature subset selection algorithm. It was found that the top image features perform much better compared with the current clinical gold-standard spirometric values when considered individually. Interestingly, it was also found that spirometric values are relatively orthogonal to these image feature values in terms of informational content.},

	Abstract = {To evaluate the ability of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to detect longitudinal changes in structural abnormalities caused by smoking, HRCT and pulmonary function tests were used to examine nonsmokers, current smokers, and past smokers annually for 5 yr. Inspiratory HRCT was taken for the upper, middle, and lower lung fields, while expiratory images were obtained for the upper and lower lung fields only. We estimated the three quantitative CT parameters including MLD (mean CT value), HIST (CT value with the most frequent appearance), and %LAA (relative area of low attenuation with CT values less than -912 HU). Most of the pulmonary function tests, excepting FEV(1), did not change annually, whereas many of the inspiratory HRCT parameters did. In nonsmokers, only %LAA in the middle or lower lung fields exhibited an annual increase. In current smokers, %LAA in the upper lung field was augmented, while inspiratory MLD or HIST in the middle or lower lung field became more positive. In past smokers, %LAA in any lung field examined increased. The annual change in %LAA in the upper lung field was larger for past smokers than nonsmokers, with little difference between past and current smokers. Expiratory CT parameters showed few annual changes in all groups. In conclusion, (1) aging increases airspace abnormalities, mainly in the lower lung field; (2) although continuous smoking worsens airspace abnormalities mainly in the upper portion of the lung, this trend does not seem to slow down even after smoking cessation; and (3) inspiratory HRCT images are superior to expiratory images for longitudinal estimation of structural abnormalities caused by aging and smoking.},

	Abstract = {RATIONALE: Low-attenuation areas assessed by computed tomography reflect the extent of pathological emphysema and correlate with airflow limitation and mortality in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The cumulative size distribution of low-attenuation area clusters follows a power law characterized by an exponent, D. The values of D reflect the complexity of the terminal airspace geometry and sensitively detect alveolar structural changes. Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have a negative impact on lung function and prognosis. However, the impact on emphysema progression remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between exacerbation and emphysema progression assessed by computed tomography in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
METHODS: Exacerbations were prospectively recorded for 2 years. Annual changes in computed tomography parameters of emphysema were compared between patients with and without a history of exacerbations.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In patients with exacerbations, increases in the percentage of low-attenuation areas and decreases in D were greater than in patients without exacerbations. To interpret these results, we established a novel simulation model and found that not only enlargement of preexisting low-attenuation areas but also coalescence of adjoining low-attenuation areas due to alveolar wall destruction caused emphysema progression in patients with exacerbations.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first longitudinal study to demonstrate that exacerbations are involved in emphysema progression in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Emphysema progression should be evaluated as part of the outcomes of exacerbations in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

	Abstract = {In patients with airflow limitation caused by cigarette smoking, lung density measured by computed tomography is strongly correlated with quantitative pathology scores of emphysema, but the ability of lung densitometry to detect progression of emphysema is disputed. We assessed the sensitivity of lung densitometry as a parameter of disease progression of emphysema in comparison to FEV(1) and gas transfer. At study baseline and after 30 months we measured computed tomography (CT)-derived lung density, spirometry and carbon monoxide diffusion coefficient in 144 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in five different centers. Annual change in lung density was 1.31 g/L/year (CI 95%: -2.12 to -0.50 HU, p=0.0015, 39.5 mL/year (CI 95%: -100.0-21.0 mL, p=0.2) for FEV(1) (-39.5 mL) and 24.3 micromol/min/kPa/L/year for gas transfer (CI 95%: -61.0-12.5 micromol/min/kPa/L/year, p=0.2). Signal-to-noise ratio (mean change divided by standard error of the change) for the detection of annual change was 3.2 for lung densitometry, but 1.3 for both FEV(1) and gas diffusion. We conclude that detection of progression of emphysema was found to be 2.5-fold more sensitive using lung densitometry than by using currently recommended lung function parameters. Our results support CT scan as an efficacious test for novel drugs for emphysema.},

@article{Parr:2008aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computer tomography (CT) densitometry is a potential tool for detecting the progression of emphysema but the optimum methodology is uncertain. The level of inspiration affects reproducibility but the ability to adjust for this variable is facilitated by whole lung scanning methods. However, emphysema is frequently localised to sub-regions of the lung and targeted densitometric sampling may be more informative than whole lung assessment.
METHODS: Emphysema progression over a 2-year interval was assessed in 71 patients (alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency with PiZ phenotype) with CT densitometry, using the 15th percentile point (Perc15) and voxel index (VI) -950 Hounsfield Units (HU) and -910 HU (VI -950 and -910) on whole lung, limited single slices, and apical, central and basal thirds. The relationship between whole lung densitometric progression (DeltaCT) and change in CT-derived lung volume (DeltaCTVol) was characterised, and adjustment for lung volume using statistical modelling was evaluated.
RESULTS: CT densitometric progression was statistically significant for all methods. DeltaCT correlated with DeltaCTVol and linear regression indicated that nearly one half of lung density loss was secondary to apparent hyperinflation. The most accurate measure was obtained using a random coefficient model to adjust for lung volume and the greatest progression was detected by targeted sampling of the middle third of the lung.
CONCLUSION: Progressive hyperinflation may contribute significantly to loss of lung density, but volume effects and absolute tissue loss can be identified by statistical modelling. Targeted sampling of the middle lung region using Perc15 appears to be the most robust measure of emphysema progression.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition that questionnaires of health status and lung density measurements are more sensitive tools for assessing progression of emphysema than forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and transfer coefficient (KCO). A study was undertaken to investigate prospectively the correlation between annual change in health status and computer tomography (CT) derived lung density in subjects with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency.
METHODS: Twenty two patients of mean (SD) age 40.7 (9.2) years with ZZ type alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency were investigated at baseline and 30 months later by FEV(1) and KCO, St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and by a spiral CT scan of the chest. CT data of chest images were analysed using software designed for automated lung contour detection and lung density measurements. The density data were corrected for changes in inspiration levels.
RESULTS: Changes in lung density, expressed as 15th percentile point or relative area below -950 HU, correlated well with changes in health status (SGRQ total score): R = -0.56, p = 0.007 or R = 0.6, p = 0.003. Neither changes in health status nor changes in lung density correlated significantly with changes in FEV(1) or changes in KCO.
CONCLUSIONS: The SGRQ total score (which is a global measure in COPD) and lung density (a specific measure of emphysema) are sensitive to deterioration in patients with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. This finding may facilitate future studies with new drugs specific for emphysema, a frequently occurring component of COPD.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate thin-section computed tomography (CT) in depicting longitudinal changes in the lung parenchyma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred eleven volunteers underwent sequential examination with thin-section CT and pulmonary function tests over a mean period of 5.5 years. According to their smoking habits between initial evaluation (T0) and follow-up (T1), the subjects were classified as persistent current smokers (n = 57), persistent nonsmokers (n = 31), persistent ex-smokers (n = 13), or quitters (n = 10).
RESULTS: Significant differences in CT findings between T0 and T1 were seen in only the group of persistent current smokers, who showed a higher frequency of emphysema (40% vs 26%; P =.005) and ground-glass attenuation (42% vs 28%; P =.02). Individual analysis of follow-up CT scans in the 19 persistent current smokers with micronodules at T0 demonstrated (a) no changes in seven cases, (b) a higher profusion of micronodules in seven cases, and (c) replacement of micronodules with emphysema in five cases. Subjects with emphysema and/or areas of ground-glass attenuation at T0 had a significantly more rapid decline in lung function than did those with a normal CT scan.
CONCLUSION: Emphysema and/or ground-glass attenuation are linked with impairment of ventilatory lung function over time in persistent current smokers.},

	Abstract = {We have investigated whether restoration of the balance between neutrophil elastase and its inhibitor, alpha(1)-antitrypsin, can prevent the progression of pulmonary emphysema in patients with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency. Twenty-six Danish and 30 Dutch ex-smokers with alpha(1)-antitrypsin deficiency of PI*ZZ phenotype and moderate emphysema (FEV(1) between 30% and 80% of predicted) participated in a double-blind trial of alpha(1)-antitrypsin augmentation therapy. The patients were randomized to either alpha(1)-antitrypsin (250 mg/kg) or albumin (625 mg/kg) infusions at 4-wk intervals for at least 3 yr. Self-administered spirometry performed every morning and evening at home showed no significant difference in decline of FEV(1) between treatment and placebo. Each year, the degree of emphysema was quantified by the 15th percentile point of the lung density histogram derived from computed tomography (CT). The loss of lung tissue measured by CT (mean +/- SEM) was 2.6 +/- 0.41 g/L/yr for placebo as compared with 1.5 +/- 0.41 g/L/yr for alpha(1)-antitrypsin infusion (p = 0.07). Power analysis showed that this protective effect would be significant in a similar trial with 130 patients. This is in contrast to calculations based on annual decline of FEV(1) showing that 550 patients would be needed to show a 50% reduction of annual decline. We conclude that lung density measurements by CT may facilitate future randomized clinical trials of investigational drugs for a disease in which little progress in therapy has been made in the past 30 yr.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Chest CT has been widely used for the evaluation of structural changes in lung parenchyma and airways in cross-sectional studies. There has been no report on the annual changes in airway dimensions as assessed by CT in COPD patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the annual changes in airway dimensions and lung attenuation using CT in patients with COPD and to evaluate the correlations among annual changes in CT measurements and pulmonary function.
METHODS: Eighty-three men with COPD had completed five annual assessments of CT scans and pulmonary function tests over 4 years. Airway dimensions of the basal segment bronchi and lung attenuation on CT images were analysed in 38 subjects in whom the same airway could be measured at least three times, including at entry and at the end of the study.
RESULTS: Mean annual decline in FEV(1) was 21 mL/year. Annual changes in the percentage of low attenuation areas were not significantly correlated with decline in FEV(1). On the other hand, annual changes in the percentage of wall area (WA%/year) were significantly inversely correlated with annual changes in FEV(1) (r = -0.363, P = 0.025), whereas WA%/year did not differ among severity stages at entry and did not correlate with baseline FEV(1).
CONCLUSIONS: The results showing that annual changes in airway thickening correlated with annual decline in air flow limitation suggests the importance of treatment of airway inflammation in COPD. CT is a useful tool for quantitative estimation not only of emphysema but also of airway lesions in longitudinal studies.},

	Abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous disease and not well understood. The forced expiratory volume in one second is used for the diagnosis and staging of COPD, but there is wide acceptance that it is a crude measure and insensitive to change over shorter periods of time. Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points (ECLIPSE) is a 3-yr longitudinal study with four specific aims: 1) definition of clinically relevant COPD subtypes; 2) identification of parameters that predict disease progression in these subtypes; 3) examination of biomarkers that correlate with COPD subtypes and may predict disease progression; and 4) identification of novel genetic factors and/or biomarkers that both correlate with clinically relevant COPD subtypes and predict disease progression. ECLIPSE plans to recruit 2,180 COPD subjects in Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease categories II-IV and 343 smoking and 223 nonsmoking control subjects. Study procedures are to be performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 months and every 6 months thereafter. Assessments include pulmonary function measurements (spirometry, impulse oscillometry and plethysmography), chest computed tomography, biomarker measurement (in blood, sputum, urine and exhaled breath condensate), health outcomes, body impedance, resting oxygen saturation and 6-min walking distance. Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-points is the largest study attempting to better describe the subtypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as defining predictive markers of its progression.},

	Abstract = {The relation of respiratory symptoms and lung function has not been extensively investigated. To determine better the rate of FEV1 decline in subjects reporting persistent wheeze, chronic cough, chronic phlegm, and/or dyspnea, longitudinal data from an adult population sample of 3,948 subjects (1,757 men; 2,191 women) followed for 12 yr were analyzed. At the initial and subsequent follow-up visits, subjects completed a standardized respiratory questionnaire and performed spirometry using the same methods and spirometers. Subjects were categorized based on the presence or absence of self-reported respiratory symptoms (persistent wheeze, chronic cough, chronic phlegm, or shortness of breath) at the initial visit. Six-specific linear regression models were fitted to determine the effect of these respiratory symptoms on lung function. In both men and women, reporting of any respiratory symptoms was associated with both a reduction in initial lung function and more rapid decline in height-adjusted FEV1. Furthermore, after adjustment for height, age, and cigarette smoking, men with cough or phlegm and women with cough alone showed accelerated loss in FEV1. Clinicians should be aware of the predictive value of these respiratory symptoms, because therapeutic intervention may modify the associated decline in lung function.},

	Abstract = {Long-term asbestos workers who insulate pipes and boilers may develop interstitial lung disease associated with loss of lung function. To quantitate annual loss of lung function, 77 individuals with chest X-rays greater than or equal to 1/0 ILO category who were life-long non-smokers or ex-smokers for greater than 5 years were evaluated. Study parameters included pulmonary function tests and bronchoalveolar lavage for a mean of 3 visits over 30 +/- 2 months. The study participants were 56 +/- 1 years old and had 31 +/- 1 years' occupational exposure to asbestos. At the first visit, multiple regression analysis revealed significant associations between rales or radiographic opacities and VC, FEV1, and total lung capacity; significant associations were also found between neutrophils/ml lavage fluid with FEV1 and diffusing capacity (all p less than 0.05). Annual declines for the asbestos-exposed were VC -92 +/- 28 ml/yr and FEV1 -66 +/- 21 ml/yr. Declines in VC and FEV1 were less in those with reduced lung function at the initial visit. There were no significant associations between any of the annual declines and cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. Compared to other asbestos-exposed cohorts followed longitudinally, asbestos insulators with radiographs greater than or equal to 1/0 and exposure greater than or equal to 20 years have larger rates of FVC and FEV1 decline for both non-smokers and ex-smokers.},

Loss of forced expired volume in one second (FEV1) over approximately 11 years was found to increase with previous cumulative dust exposure after allowing for the effects of age, height, smoking, and overall colliery differences. This relationship was found to hold with concurrent dust exposure only when colliery differences were ignored. These results confirm by direct measurement inferences drawn indirectly from previous cross-sectional studies of the relationship between FEV1 and dust exposure.},

	Abstract = {Most patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) exhibit lung involvement. However, the natural history of lung disease in PSS remains poorly defined. To evaluate lung function over time in PSS, a battery of lung function tests were prospectively performed serially between 1973 and 1982 in 61 patients with PSS. Functional indexes of restriction (vital capacity and total lung capacity) and diffusion impairment (diffusing capacity) showed greater-than-expected annual rates of change. Male subjects showed a trend toward faster declines in forced vital capacity, forced expired volume in one second, total lung capacity, and functional residual capacity and a more rapid increase in static recoil pressure at 90 percent of total lung capacity than did female subjects. Nonsmokers had greater rates of decline in total lung capacity and static lung compliance (but not in forced vital capacity or diffusing capacity) and a greater rate of increase in static recoil pressure than did current and former smokers. Level of lung function at initial study visit, age, race, and chlorambucil therapy had no significant effect on the annual rates of change in lung function, whereas longer duration of disease prior to study entry was associated with a slower annual decrease in lung volumes. Between the first and last visits (mean interval 3.1 years, maximum nine years), the frequency of abnormality in pulmonary function test results showed significant change only in the diffusing capacity (60 percent increasing to 82 percent) and static lung compliance (40 percent increasing to 54 percent), whereas the frequency of respiratory symptoms showed little change. These findings indicate an overall indolent progression of PSS-related lung disease, with substantial individual variability.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The outcome of childhood asthma in adults has been described in high-risk cohorts, but few population-based studies have reported the risk factors for persistence and relapse.
METHODS: We assessed children born from April 1972 through March 1973 in Dunedin, New Zealand, repeatedly from 9 to 26 years of age with questionnaires, pulmonary-function tests, bronchial-challenge testing, and allergy testing.
RESULTS: By the age of 26 years, 51.4 percent of 613 study members with complete respiratory data had reported wheezing at more than one assessment. Eighty-nine study members (14.5 percent) had wheezing that persisted from childhood to 26 years of age, whereas 168 (27.4 percent) had remission, but 76 (12.4 percent) subsequently relapsed by the age of 26. Sensitization to house dust mites predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 2.41; P=0.001) and relapse (odds ratio, 2.18; P=0.01), as did airway hyperresponsiveness (odds ratio for persistence, 3.00; P<0.001; odds ratio for relapse, 3.03; P<0.001). Female sex predicted the persistence of wheezing (odds ratio, 1.71; P=0.03), as did smoking at the age of 21 years (odds ratio, 1.84; P=0.01). The earlier the age at onset, the greater the risk of relapse (odds ratio, 0.89 per year of increase in the age at onset; P<0.001). Pulmonary function was consistently lower in those with persistent wheezing than in those without persistent wheezing.
CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected birth cohort, more than one in four children had wheezing that persisted from childhood to adulthood or that relapsed after remission. The factors predicting persistence or relapse were sensitization to house dust mites, airway hyperresponsiveness, female sex, smoking, and early age at onset. These findings, together with persistently low lung function, suggest that outcomes in adult asthma may be determined primarily in early childhood.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of randomly assigning smokers who have early chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to a smoking-cessation intervention on the symptoms of chronic cough, chronic phlegm production, wheezing and shortness of breath, and to determine the effects of quitting smoking on these symptoms.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 5,887 male and female smokers 35 to 60 years of age with early COPD [defined as a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 55% to 90% of predicted and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) <0.70] were enrolled in a 5-year clinical trial. Two-thirds of participants were randomly assigned to smoking-intervention groups and one-third to a usual-care group. The intervention groups attended 12 intensive smoking-cessation sessions that included behavior modification techniques and the use of nicotine chewing gum. One intervention group was treated with ipratropium bromide by inhaler; the other intervention group received placebo inhalers. The usual-care group was advised to stop smoking. All participants were followed annually. Smoking status was biochemically validated by salivary cotinine measurements or exhaled carbon monoxide values.
RESULTS: Validated 5-year sustained smoking cessation occurred in 22% of participants in the intervention compared with only 5% of participants in the usual-care group. At the end of the study, the prevalence of each of the four symptoms in the two intervention groups was significantly less than in the usual-care group (P <0.0001). For example, among participants who did not report cough at baseline, 15% of those in the intervention groups had cough at least 3 months during the year, compared with 23% of those in usual care. Sustained quitters had the lowest prevalence of all four symptoms, whereas continuous smokers had the greatest prevalence of these symptoms. Changes in symptoms occurred primarily in the first year after smoking cessation. Respiratory symptoms were associated with greater declines in FEV1 during the study (P <0.001). Ipratropium bromide had no long-term effects on respiratory symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective randomized trial using an intention-to-treat analysis, smokers with early COPD who were assigned to a smoking-cessation intervention had fewer respiratory symptoms after 5 years of follow-up.},

	Abstract = {Effects of cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on rate of FEV1 decline over 6 yr were examined in 4,451 Japanese-American men from the Honolulu Heart Program who were 45 to 68 yr of age at baseline (1965-1968). Within-person regression was used to calculate annual change in FEV1. Rates of FEV1 decline varied strongly with smoking status and increased significantly with age. Overall, men who continued to smoke experienced steeper rates of decline compared with men who never smoked (-33 ml/yr versus -22 ml/yr, respectively; p = 0.0001). Rates of decline for those who quit smoking during the first 2 yr (-32 ml/yr) were nearly the same as those who continued smoking (-34 ml/yr). After quitting, their rates of decline diminished to a level (-19 ml/yr) similar to that of men who had never smoked (-21 ml/yr). FEV1 decline in continuing smokers was significantly associated with duration of smoking, whereas associations with intensity and pack-years were of borderline significance. Among 216 men with impaired pulmonary function, those who quit smoking had significantly slower rates of FEV1 decline than did those who continued smoking. Potential reasons for quitting included respiratory conditions and stroke. These results extend previous reports of accelerated rates of FEV1 decline in the persons who continue to smoke, and they indicate that smoking cessation leads to less steep rates of decline in pulmonary function over a short period of time in middle-aged men, as well as in men with established pulmonary impairment.},
